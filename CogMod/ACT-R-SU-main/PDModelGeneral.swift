/// This struct serves a proxy for the model class
/// Because SwiftUI deals with structs, we need a struct that can serve as an
/// intermediate. The update function copies the relevant information out of the
/// Model object into the struct.
/// In addition, the struct implements the game logic by assigning points to choices,
/// by tracking the scores and by giving feedback.
///
/// This is the first of three versions
/// In this version, we load in a text file with an ACT-R model in the ACT-R syntax.
/// The advantage is that it guarentees the model adheres to ACT-R's constraints,
/// and that the modeling software takes care of timing, buffer updates, etc.
/// De disadvantage is that you need experience with the ACT-R syntax, and that
/// it is harder to debug the model.
